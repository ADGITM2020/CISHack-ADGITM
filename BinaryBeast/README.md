#### The Need for the Project

Manual management of inventory is a cumbersome task when it comes to a large stock in a
company. Project ANYERP looks into this matter and automates this process. Other than
inventory management, ANYERP is capable of managing bills and other product details. In
the current context, getting statistical information about the product of a brand and a set of products needs extra effort to do sell separately. ANYERP provides a solution to this problem by providing automatically generated statistical information in many aspects.

1. Product quality
2. Product availability
3. Maintenance
4. Overall statistical distribution in a product
