## Inspiration
The inspiration came from the various people who were travelling so long for just collecting their lab reports, people who were worried about their lost prescriptions, people who were not aware of the availability time of the doctors, people who use to forget to keep their documents with them in a hurry and last but not the least, crowded hospitals became the major inspiration during COVID-19.

## What it does
Horizon is a patient centered information exchange system that allows patients to upload their medical documents so that they can be accessed online. It allows the respective doctors to write online prescriptions and upload the latest test reports online. It is making the hospitals crowd-free as people who just visit the hospitals for the sake of lab reports will no longer come. No one is allowed to access and edit the details until unless the respective doctor and the respective patient are connected.

## How we built it

## Challenges we ran into
1. It was really difficult to control the flow of data, also to ensure that no extra person could access and edit the details.
2. It took us a lot of time to make the web app responsive.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are really happy to keep the patient at the center of all we did. It gives us immense pleasure to create a safe and effective patient experience and make their life easy. 


## What we learned
1. We learned to try things before saying we can’t do it.
2. We learned to work with others and listen.
3. We got to know about the healthcare system.
4. It helped in making our concepts more seamless and clear.


## What's next for Horizon
We are planning to include a chatbot in our web app which will allow the patient to share the symptoms and it will revert back with the possible diseases. It will tell whether there is a need for a medical emergency or not.
